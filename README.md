This project  wrote just for fun. As far is I remember, it should be a part of complex combain to secure testing, but something went wrong. 

So itâ€™s simple module to find open 22 (or other ports) at IP range.

For security testing better use something like **NMAP**.

If you are still so curious that you want to run it, just `clone the git`, `cd` to folders and edit index.js. There are two variables: START_IP_RANGE and END_IP_RANGE, set Ips you want to scan. And just start:

`node index.js`


#### Have a nice day!
